# REACT-MQTT

## This project is intended to allow visualizations to be created from data provided by LF-EdgeX Foundry

### Data can be simulated or gathered from actual connected devices.

### configurable settings will be hard-coded or defaulted to known good values to work with EdgeX

### the master branch is built using React 16 because that was the version used to create the demo it is based on, which can be read about [Here](https://mpolinowski.github.io/docs/Development/Javascript/2021-06-01--mqtt-with-reactjs/2021-06-01/).

### branches bumpReactVersion, 3d-device-model and 3d-model-simplified are React 18
